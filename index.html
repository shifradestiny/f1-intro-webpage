      <p class="paragraph-one">
        Formula 1, commonly referred to as F1, is the
        <strong> highest form of racing internationally</strong>. Specifically
        for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars. It is overlooked by
        the <em>F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile</em>, shortly known as
        the FIA. The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the
        premier form of racing across the world since its inaugural season.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-two">
        Formula 1 drivers are extremely daring individuals, racing at speeds of
        up to 370 km/h. The sport only allows for
        <span class="team">10 teams of 2 drivers</span> each to compete. This
        makes it a very competitive sport, allowing only for the best of the
        best to have a chance in the sport. This also pushes the drivers to
        maximise their potential and push their cars to the limit. Teams build,
        design, and prepare their cars for racing in their respective factories.
        Changing all 4 tires on the cars in under 2 seconds during pit stops is
        a prime example of how hard teams work to be precise and have good
        teamwork dynamics.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-three">
        There are 24 Formula 1 races every year, that take place in amazing
        locations across 5 continents, spanning cities worldwide. This is what
        makes F1 a truly international sport. Each race is a high-stakes battle
        for supremacy in the sport.
